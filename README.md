📊 Project Highlights: Diabetes Patients Prediction model using python🩺.
Excited to share my latest project on diabetes patient data analysis, part of my ongoing internship with hashtag#meriskill 🌟

Overview 📝 :-

The project conducted as part of my internship with hashtag#MeriSKILL, aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on various diagnostic measurements. The dataset used in this project is originally taken from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This task has not only tested my analytical skills but also allowed me to apply various machine-learning algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems.

Dataset 📊 :-
1. The dataset includes several features (independent variables).
2. It has only one target variable (Outcome) indicating whether a patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

Features 📌 :-

1. Pregnancies: The number of pregnancies a patient has going through.
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration( an indicator of blood sugar levels).
3. Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
4. Skin Thickness: Skinfold thickness (related to body composition).
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin level.
6. BMI: A measure of body weight and height (indicating body fat).
7. Diabetes Pedigree Function: A measure of the diabetes heredity risk based on family history.
8. Age: The age of the patient in years.
9. Target Variable:

Outcome 👉 :-
Indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1 for positive, 0 for negative).

Project Structure 📑 -->

1. Data Exploration: Initial exploration and analysis of the dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and converting numerical data into categorical variables.
3. Model Building: Developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
4. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various evaluation metrics.
5. Conclusion: Recommendations and conclusions based on model performance.
